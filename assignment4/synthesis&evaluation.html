   <h2>Introduction section:</h2>
   <p>The Website, which was developed during Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 has the name of ‘WEBSHOP A1’ which is displayed on our navigation bar. The navigation bar of our website also has a ‘Home’ button, which directs a user to the product list table, ‘Order’ button directs user to the end of our website to the product form section, and the ‘Google’ button opens google.com web page. Below we have a product list, where the products of our website are displayed. Product contents like image, brand, model, operating system, screensize are shown in a table. Further we provide the information about our default products, insert a youtube video on the difference between our default products, and name things on why people should use our website. Then we display the delivery information, to introduce our customers to our shipment details. The last section of our website is the product attachment form, where the users of our website can add custom products to the website by specifying their content. And finally, we have a ‘submit’ button, which submits the information provided via the form and the ‘reset’ button, which resets the data to the default.</p>
